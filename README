Soliloque Server
================

Welcome to Soliloque Server!


Getting the code
----------------

Check out http://github.com/Youx/soliloque-server for the wiki, bug tracking, etc...
The bleeding edge code can be grabbed from the git repository on github :

	$ git clone git://github.com/Youx/soliloque-server.git

For information about Git, please see http://www.git-scm.com


How to build soliloque server
-----------------------------

To build soliloque server from source, you will need : 
- a C compiler (most likely gcc)
- libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/), a library to parse config files
- libdbi (http://libdbi.sf.net), a database abstraction library, and the specific drivers (mysql, sqlite3, ...)

Then run

	$ ./waf configure
	$ ./waf build

You can install it, which isn't really recommended yet...

	$ sudo ./waf install

Or use the binary output/default/soliloque-server


Preparing the database
======================

There are two scripts to prepare a database :

db_generator.sql	: generate the tables
db_sample.sql		: generate a server with some standard values

Those script are compatible with sqlite3, and may work with mysql or postgresql, for example :

	$ sqlite3 file.db3 < db_generator.sql
	$ sqlite3 file.db3 < db_sample.sql

NB: You can also now use the gen_db.sh script to do those two tasks.

Then edit your sol-server.cfg file accordingly (examples for mysql or sqlite3/sqlite are included)


Known Incompatibilities
-----------------------

Full protocol support is not achieved yet.

Some problems seem to happen when using sqlite3 v3.5.9 + libdbi v0.8.2, but sqlite3 v3.6.10 + libdbi v0.8.3 works fine.


Hardware Requirements
---------------------

The application compiled takes ~67k or disk with debug flags, and 53-57k without the debug flags,
depending on the optimization level.

Soliloque server hopefully does not leak too much memory, and can run an empty server with ...
~500kBytes of RAM (~350kBytes of those being the database library). Each additional player or
channel takes about 300 Bytes, so it could probably run on an embedded linux device.
